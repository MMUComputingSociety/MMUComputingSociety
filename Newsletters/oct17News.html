                        This Wednesday 4 October we are holding an Unreal Tournament Event at C0.13b in the John Dalton building from 1pm.

If you have not played Unreal Tournament from Epic Games before you can download and play it for free <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/unrealtournament/#splash">here.</a> As this is not a standard campus application we will show you how to install it from our folder in the Staff2Student drive on the university machines on Wednesday.

                    <h3>Introduction to HTML/CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        On wednesday 11 October we will be running a very simple into to HTML/CSS workshop in C0.13b in the John Dalton building. The workshop will last about 50 minuts and we will cover the basics of creating a simle portfolio page for yourself and stying it with CSS. Some of you will be doing this during the year in your Introduction to Web Design unit, however we are providing this workshop primarily for students who are not taking this unit. Everyone is still welcome to attend however, even if you are taking the web design unit. A portfolio website is a simple to create but powerful tool to showcase your work to potential employers in the future.
